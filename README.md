This fire evacuation system project addresses the need for enhanced building safety
during fire emergencies. The target audience includes building owners, occupants,
and emergency responders seeking a comprehensive solution for efficient
evacuation. The goals of the system are to improve evacuation procedures, minimize
response time, and enhance overall safety.
The project integrates hardware, software, and graphical modeling techniques. A
physical miniature model of a four-story building is equipped with flame and motion
sensors on each floor, monitoring fire sources and tracking individuals' whereabouts.
Using Python's Matplotlib and igraph libraries, the system collects and analyzes
sensor data to calculate optimal evacuation paths considering fire locations,
proximity to exits, and occupancy. The calculated paths are displayed on a 3D
graphical model, with color-coded edges indicating recommended routes. LED
sensors on the physical model guide individuals along the evacuation path.
Real-time monitoring is enabled through a computer-based dashboard connected to
a database. The dashboard displays the 3D model, evacuation paths, and sensor
data updates. The system integrates the Twilio library to enable occupants to contact
the fire department via WhatsApp in emergencies.
This fire evacuation system offers an effective solution for building safety, providing
clear guidance and facilitating timely responses. By combining hardware integration,
advanced algorithms, and graphical visualization, the system improves evacuation
procedures, reduces response time, and ensures the safety of building occupants.
